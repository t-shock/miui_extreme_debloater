# Extreme debloater for MIUI 13 (Android 12)
A script made to remove bloatware (Mi & Google apps) from Xiaomi.eu MIUI 13.04 and MIUI 13 stock (Global & EEA edition) for Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G. I'm sure that there is more stuff to remove, so feel free to let me know what else you want me to include.

Only tested on xiaomi.eu roms and EEA stock, but it may as well work on others too.

Customize to your own taste. I like mine barebones.
